An elegant, single-file quiz that helps you discover which role from Simon Wardleyâ€™s EVTP framework best fits you: Explorer, Villager, or Town Planner. Built with vanilla HTML/JS and Tailwind via CDN â€” no build step, no dependencies.

### Features
- **Zero setup**: open `index.html` in a browser
- **Responsive UI**: TailwindCSS + Inter font
- **Simple logic**: 8 questions, randomized answers, progress bar
- **Tie handling**: fair random pick among tied top roles
- **Accessible touches**: focus styles, Escape closes the framework modal
- **URL-based navigation**: Shareable links to specific questions and states
- **Browser history support**: Back/forward buttons work during navigation
- **State persistence**: Quiz progress survives page refreshes (for 1 hour)

### Navigation Features
The quiz now supports modern web navigation with shareable URLs:

- **Home**: `#/` or just the base URL
- **Questions**: `#/quiz/1`, `#/quiz/2`, etc. (up to `#/quiz/8`)
- **Results**: `#/results`
- **Framework Modal**: `#/framework`

**Examples:**
- Direct link to question 3: `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/#/quiz/3`
- Share your results: `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/#/results`
- Link to framework explanation: `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/#/framework`

This works perfectly on GitHub Pages and other static hosting services using hash-based routing.

### Quick start
- **Option A (double-click)**: Open `index.html` in your browser.
- **Option B (local server)**: Useful if you prefer a local URL.

```bash
# From the project root
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

### What is EVTP?
EVTP stands for Explorers, Villagers, and Town Planners â€” three complementary roles in Wardleyâ€™s strategy framework. This quiz offers a lightweight way to self-assess which role you naturally lean toward.

The live version is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. You can also view the original framework by Simon Wardley [here](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2023/12/how-to-organise-yourself-dangerous-path.html).

### Project structure

â”œâ”€â”€ EVTP.011.jpeg        # Framework image (used on results + modal)
â””â”€â”€ index.html           # Entire app (UI, questions, logic)
```

### Customize the quiz
All content and logic live inside `index.html`.

- **Questions**: Update the `quizQuestions` array. Each answer maps to a `type` of `explorer`, `villager`, or `townPlanner`.
- **Results copy**: Edit the `resultsData` object (titles/descriptions for each role).
- **Styling**: Change Tailwind utility classes in the HTML for colors, spacing, etc. You can also add custom CSS in the `<style>` block at the top of the file.
- **Add a role**: Add a new `type` value in answers, extend the `scores` objectâ€™s keys, and add an entry to `resultsData`. Ensure the type strings match across all three.

### How scoring works
- Each selected answer increments the score for its `type`.
- The highest total wins.
- If thereâ€™s a tie between top roles, a fair random choice is made among the tied roles.

### Tech stack
- HTML + vanilla JavaScript
- [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) for routing
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Google Fonts (Inter) via CDN

### Deploy
Because this is a static site, any static host works.

- **GitHub Pages** (Automatic via GitHub Actions)
  1. Push this repository to GitHub (already done!)
  2. The site automatically deploys when you push to the `main` branch
  3. Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see deployment status
  4. Your site will be available at `https://BrianMcBrayer.github.io/wardley-classification/`
  5. See the official docs: [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) handles the deployment automatically on every push to main.

### Accessibility
- Uses semantic buttons and visible focus rings
- Modal supports closing with the Escape key
- Consider adding focus trapping in the modal and ARIA `role="dialog"` if you want stricter accessibility behavior
